# DestroyPrettyPages
Destroys all the pretty, but pretty useless, crap some poor junior web developer spent hours on to get the shade of blue just right, from documentation sites. Leaving the end user with a **single**, easily printable pdf to read the documentation. That is why we documentation sites after all, not for click bait or any, any, anything at all else. Not for "Check out our new product"-banners, not clicking our fingers to the bone as we jump from link to link. Just a nice, coherent, linear, single pdf. 

TODO:
A LOOOOOOOT
- Images/Video relevant ot the documentation should be included
- Currently, a "ruleset" is used. Each domain's CSS selectors determines what parts to keep
- A better, or any UI, would be a start
- Rewrite it all in node using cheerio. It just makes so much more sense. At least not Beautifulsoup. Even their (very nicely laid out, I would like to add) documentation says what I've done here is useless for bs4. "Rather use lxml"
